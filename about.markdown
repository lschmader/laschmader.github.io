Hi there! My name is Landon Schmader and I have created a great manual of how to navigate around the OpenAI interface! I have designed my manual to be divided into six sections, so you can get the most detail out of everything that OpenAI has to offer! The whole reason that I decided to do this project wads for my CMPSC 104 Final Project and I thought it was a great choice to test my skills! Thank you Professor Hang for a great semester!
