OpenAI Playground is commonly mistaken with its very close cousin ChatGPT, which can be quite understandable! However, ChatGPT was designed specifically for the public use (people without a lot of computer science background), while OpenAI playground was designed for developers to test their *intricate* AI models.

OpenAI is free to use for all developers (except for some select features) and allows users to select from many different AI models they may want to test!

OpenAI is also quite customizable, as you can place any sort of data set you would like inside of the interface of the OpenAI playground. Along with being able to provide your own dataset, OpenAI playground also gives users the options to select any variable they would like to see highlighted in the test of their AI model!

OpenAI will be able to help developers everywhere because it gives a much easier path on how to apply all of the information provided by machine learning models! Let's dive into more of the cool features about OpenAI!
