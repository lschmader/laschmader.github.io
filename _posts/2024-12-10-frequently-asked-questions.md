Here's some questions you may have about OpenAI!

### What Model to Use?

After doing my research it seems that the best model to use on OpenAI's interface is either *gpt-40* or *gpt-40-mini*.

*gpt-40* is a great choice if you are trying to find some analysis about different images or long passages of text! It is is also the cheapest option of the models that have this feature!

*gpt-40-mini* is the fastest and cheapest model out of the bunch and allows you to have more freedom with how long your prompts can be!

### Can I fine-tune the existing models?

Yes, most of the time you can fine-tune any model you would like to look at!

However, there are times when certain models are not available for fine-tuning! Check out this [link](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) for more info!

### Should I use ChatGPT or OpenAI API?

This really depends on your background as both have great features! OpenAI does have a lot more options for custimization, but requires a knowledge of programming to test the models.

ChatGPT definitely has less features, but is more accessible to the genera public that might not have as much coding background!
