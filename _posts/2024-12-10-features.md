When you begin to play around with the ablities of OpenAI Playground, you will see that there are many great things that you can do with it!

Some of these are:

- Generating/Summarizing Text
- Having a Conversation
- Completing Code

Before I get into the details of all these features, I wanted to give you a sense of what the interface of the OpenAI playground looks like!

Notice that along the right-hand side is where you can test all of the different models that OpenAI playground has to offer! Also on the right sidebar, there is the temperature slider which allows users to have the AI create unique responses to the tasks they are asked to do. (higher the temperature, more unique response)

Now let's dive into all the different features!

### Generating/Summarizing Text

Probably one of the most popular features that OpenAI playground offers would definitely be the ability to generate text for **many** different instances.

With any model on the OpenAI playground, you can type in any prompt and the AI can give you back a great creative response

For example, you could ask OpenAI to create a two paragraph response on different facts about United States history. Then, OpenAI will take all of the data that was provided about United States history that it knows and can provide a clean and informative response to the question.

Not only can OpenAI generate text, but it can also summarize different passages or book chapters as well!

If it is a well known book, you can type "summarize Chapter 10 of (the book you are reading)" and it will provide a thorough summary of the section of text!

This feature can be really helpful to get you started on a book report or help you understand confusing material much quicker!

These are just some highlights of what OpenAI can do when it is generating or summarizing text! If you would like to check out more features about OpenAI generating text, check out this [link!](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation)

### Having a Conversation

If you are ever feeling:

1. Bored
2. Like you need a friend
3. Chatty

this is the feature of OpenAI playground you need to utilize!

I think that this is one the really cool features that come with OpenAI because it seems *very* futuristic! Who would have thought that you could have a conversation with a computer?

All of the OpenAI models have been trained to be able to have a conversation with you about any subject you might like!

All you have to do is pick a topic interesting to you and it's just like talking to a friend in person!

This feature of OpenAI could be quite helpful for trying to simulate what a conversation might go like. You might have to mess around with the creativity settings on each model, but it could definitely be worth it!

Here's what an image of what a sample conversation could like with OpenAI playground:

Note that the green text refers to the computer generated response and the text that is not highlighted is the text that you have entered into the model! Isn't it so realistic?!

There's not an example of it provided here, but you can also have a truly normal conversation with OpenAI by just speaking into your device! This is because OpenAI also has voice recognition ablities as well!

### Completing Code

The last feature of OpenAI that I will be talking about is how OpenAI can complete code for you! This is definitely where OpenAI stands out because this is a feature that directly benefits developers.

I know as a person that is beginning to learn the basics of computer science, that this tool could be very helpful as it provides extra chances for me to comprehend the syntax that I need to master for each coding language.

I can also see benefits for experienced developers who have **thousands and thousands** lines of code in front of them and they need a tool to help them be more efficient!

OpenAI has been known to code many different types of games, mathematical projects, and create memes, so the opportunities are truly endless while coding with the assistance of OpenAI!

Now that we have learned about some ofd the features that OpenAI playground can offer, let's first see how we can access them!
